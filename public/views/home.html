          <small>We need your help to ensure the safety and security of our students and to also ensure that our program is the strongest one it can be. We are asking each parent to volunteer 2.5 hours per year either as a Lobby Greeter, Pick-up Volunteer, Front-Desk Coverage, or Snack Bar. All volunteers will be receiving directions on what to expect during the shift. If you need to cancel last minute, please notify Ali King at ali.king@betshalom.org or (952) 426-6649. </small>

        </h3>
        <p>Snack Bar volunteers help by setting up and selling snacks to our 3rd-8th graders before class on Wednesday evenings.
          There are detailed notes for volunteers and will always be someone present to take the lead in directing volunteer
          support.

        <p>Lobby Greeters will sit at a desk in the Religious School Entrance, or the Main Entrance during Religious School
          hours. Greeters will welcome families as they enter and direct any questions as appropriate. Greeters will also
          alert a staff person if any suspicious person enters or if any inappropriate activity occurs.</p>

          accompanied by a parent. This person may also be responsible for gathering students' names from each car and relaying
          them to the person at the front desk (who will then page students to come out at that time).</p>
